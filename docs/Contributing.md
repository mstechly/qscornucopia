# Contributing

The Cornucopia of Quantum Subroutines works thanks to the contributions from people around the globe. If you see there's a subroutine missing, consider contributing it to the project!

## How does it work?

1. Check if subroutine you want to add is not already present in the Wiki (use search tool in top right corner).
2. Fork the wiki.
3. Create pull request.
4. Wait for it to get merged.
